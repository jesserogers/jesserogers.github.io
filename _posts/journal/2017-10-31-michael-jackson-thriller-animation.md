It's Halloween! You know what that means: every creative team on the planet had to make something for their company to post on the internet for it.

Last year, I did something lame at work for Halloween. A pumpkin with some tech-related symbol carved into it. Super lame.

This year, I decided to step it up and animate something fun. During a lunch break, my best friend/colleague Adam and I came up with the idea to have Michael Jackson doing the Thriller dance, but also typing on a computer.

<div class="callout">
  <div class="callout-content">
    <img src="/assets/img/journal/2017-10-31-michael-jackson-halloween.gif" alt="Michael Jackson Thriller dance at computer">
  </div>
</div>

Definitely spent more time laughing at the result than I did making it. It's a good time.

Okay, I may or may not have redesigned and coded an entire new website for my company and launched it almost a month ago, and the next post should definitely be about that. I will get around to it.

I also made some nice improvements to the script on the lightbox component on this site that I mentioned in the [last post](/journal/2017/08/11/new-website/), and maybe I'll break that down for my fellow nerds who might be interested.

Thanks for reading.
