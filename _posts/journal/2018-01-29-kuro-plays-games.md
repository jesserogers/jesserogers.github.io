I've decided I'm gonna not start every post with, "Wow I haven't posted in forever" because that's going to get redundant real quick.

I've been working on some <a href="/projects/" title="View new projects">cool stuff</a>, but other than that, I've been spending a lot of my scarce free time playing video games lately.

Some of my close friends who live far away got me into Destiny, and I fell in love with online gaming with my friends. Late nights, drunk PVP, teabagging, and tons of laughs. I uploaded a montage or two back in the glory days of D1.

Destiny 2 is out now and it's disappointing (albeit improving), but the gunplay is unmatched in any game, so I keep playing it, and I feel like I'm actually getting pretty good.

So I decided to start a YouTube channel and start saving and editing footage, and I started posting some more Destiny 2 videos in late 2017 under the name **kuroplaysgames**.

Some of the videos are more about the banter, like this one with my friend and former bandmate Corey (cumbersomehammer).

But most of them are just sniper headshots and teabagging.
