Well, Squarespace, we had a good run. You're probably the best consumer-oriented CMS on the market. Your ease of use is unquestionable, and you do drag-and-drop better than anyone else I've ever seen.

But I'm a _developer_, dammit, and I don't need to pay you guys $20 a month to house my work in a restrictive template when I could code a cooler website myself in no time.

And when I say "no time" I mean about three months, apparently? I started putting this site together in May (on a plane) and worked on it sporadically. Now it's August, and I will _not_ get billed by Squarespace again.

## So welcome to my new website!

This site is hosted on Github Pages, built with Jekyll/Liquid, and runs on HTML5, SCSS, and jQuery (thanks Google ajax). Every single line of code was lovingly written by yours truly, utilizing an incomplete version of a very, _very_ simple framework/component library I've been putting together at Adaptiva.

I thought it'd be fun to see what goes into coding a portfolio site and what I could do with it. I probably spent the majority of my dev time on the lightbox component, which I'm sure could've been engineered a little more efficiently, but whatever! I think it's a pretty slick experience, and I'll improve on the code over time. Will add support for swipe gestures and arrow keys later on.

This is somewhat of a clean start for me, too. At this point in my life, I feel like I can put up only the work that I _like_, rather than work I think might get me hired. I can write almost whatever and certainly whenever I want in this journal, so I think I'll do just that.

I'll post new work here if I'm particularly stoked about about it, and I'll post random thoughts, sketches, life updates, and whatever else I feel like sharing here, too.

Idk, maybe I'll add a subscription component to this journal if I actually use it enough. Someday.

Thanks for reading. (:
